# Welcome to CNED-API
## An API to get your CNED Homeworks

### How to make it work ?  
- Install python
- Do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the folder
- Put your username in the first line and password in the second of the creds.txt file (you have to create it)
- Run the app
- Go to ``` http://localhost:5000/hws```  to get the data

You can easily integrate this with discord bot or anything to run the endpoint and get datas
